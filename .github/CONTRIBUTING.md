## WARNING

This is the repository of the original LWJGL, which is no longer actively maintained. Unless you have released a product that uses LWJGL 2.x, you should probably be looking at [LWJGL 3](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3).

If you decide to proceed, it is very likely that:

- LWJGL maintainers won't be able to address your issue. Your best hope is an external contribution, which happens very rarely.
- Your issue is not an issue in LWJGL 3.
- Your issue has already been fixed in LWJGL 3.
 
If it is impossible for you to migrate to LWJGL 3, make sure to:

- Describe your issue as clearly as possible.
- Include information about your system/environment.
- Include a minimal code sample that reproduces the issue.
 
In any case, feature requests will almost certainly be ignored. If you need new features, you're very welcome to open an issue in the LWJGL 3 repository.
