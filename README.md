# README

This project is a continuation of the LWJGLv2 library, which was EOL'd in 2015 (https://legacy.lwjgl.org/index.php.html).
 
Modern systems, notably modern MacOS cannot run games built on the older library, so this is a port to bring it up to date and hopefully make a bunch of old, fun games able to run.

## Building

Build using Java 8 (Apple Silicon macs will need a native JDK 8 - currently only available from Azul)

Uses ant (ugh).

## Supported Systems

* MacOS (tested on 14)
* Linux (tested on Fedora 39)
* ?? Windows
